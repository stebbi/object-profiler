This is a toy project to learn a bit about Scala and the Scala toolchain. 

The code implements an "object profiler". It's a bit like a memory profiler, only different:

 - Instead of collecting information about heap space allocation, it collects information about JVM objects and object relationships.

 - Instead of showing how allocated memory is divided between classes, it starts with a "root object" and shows the tree formed by the objects' member fields and bean properties. 

 - Instead of inspecting how memory allocation changes between timestamps, it inspects field and property value changes in the tree formed from the root object.
